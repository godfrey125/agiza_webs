# App store badge assets

These images are official store badges. They are rendered only when the matching
published listing URL is configured:

| File | Official source | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `google-play.png` | Google Play badge assets, `play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/` | `VITE_APP_PLAY_STORE_URL` |
| `app-store.svg` | Apple App Store badge assets, `developer.apple.com/assets/elements/badges/` | `VITE_APP_APP_STORE_URL` |

Do not recolour, crop, rearrange or re-create these images. Use the supplied
files unmodified, at a readable size, and only link them to the genuine listing
for a published Agiza app.

If a listing is not published, leave its environment variable blank. The
homepage then shows a clearly labelled “Coming soon” platform card instead of a
download badge.
